    <p>Pilates exercises develop the body through muscular effort that stems from the core. The technique cultivates awareness of the body to support everyday movements that are efficient and graceful.</p>
    <p>As such, Pilates has been popular among dancers but it appeals to a wider audience. The Pilates Method was developed by Joseph Pilates during the 1920s.</p>
